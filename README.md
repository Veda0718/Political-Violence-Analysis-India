# Insights into India's Political Landscape: Analyzing Violence Hotspots

## Project Overview
This analysis explores patterns and clusters in incidents of political violence across India (excluding islands, Kashmir, and Ladakh). Utilizing clustering algorithms, the study aims to understand the spatial distribution of these incidents and identify underlying factors contributing to their clustering.

## Key Questions
 - What is the optimal number of clusters for analyzing political violence incidents in India, and how do we determine this?
 - Can clustering reveal significant patterns or trends in the distribution of political violence incidents, and what might these patterns indicate about underlying causes?
 - How do geographical clusters correlate with socio-political or economic factors, and are there historical contexts influencing their formation?

## Findings
 - Four main clusters of political violence incidents were identified across India, highlighting significant regional differences in frequency and nature.
 - Hotspots for political violence emerged in states like Punjab, Haryana (including New Delhi), West Bengal, Chattisgarh, and Meghalaya, influenced by factors such as political unrest and socio-economic disparities.
 - The analysis suggests differing patterns of political violence between urban and rural areas, with urban settings often serving as focal points due to higher population density and political activity.

## Conclusion
The analysis sheds light on the spatial dynamics of political violence in India, emphasizing the importance of nuanced approaches to address regional disparities and underlying factors. By uncovering patterns and clusters, policymakers can develop targeted interventions to promote peace and stability, contributing to more peaceful socio-political environments in the country.
